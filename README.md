# This python file reads data directly from the Honeywell HPMA115S0 Dust 
# particulate laser interferometer device, validates the data stream per
# Honeywell's published protocol and logs the values with a date/time stamp 
# to a CSV file
# This was designed for a friend to connect the HMPA sensor directly to
# the RPI GPIO header and log with minimal interaction.
